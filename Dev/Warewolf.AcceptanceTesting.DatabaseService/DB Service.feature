Scenario: Ensure recordset values can be saved to a variable

	And I have a saved Data Connector called "MyDataCon"
	And "MyDataCon" returns [[dbo_GetCountries().CountryID]] and [[dbo_GetCountries().Description]]

	And I open the Database Connector to a large view
	When I change  [[dbo_GetCountries().CountryID]] to "[[variable]]"
	And "MyDataCon" is executed

	And the debug output is
	|              |                           |
